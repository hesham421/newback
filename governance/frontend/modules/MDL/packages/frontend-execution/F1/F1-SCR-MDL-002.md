### F1 · SCR-MDL-002 — سجل أنواع اللوكب حسب المالك / Lookup-type registry by owner

#### F1-MODEL — OwnerGroupResponse — المجموعة حسب المالك / Owner group
Source DTO   : `OwnerGroupResponse[]` — a bare array (API-MDL-010); this screen writes nothing
  ownerModuleCode : string · read-only — the group key, labelled through UXD-MDL-001
  types[]         : the same type projection as above, **every property read-only here** —
                    lookupTypePk, key, ownerModuleCode, nameAr, nameEn, isActiveFl and the audit
                    four. The type model of `F1-SCR-MDL-001` is reused, not re-declared; only its
                    writability differs, and on this screen there is none.

**No F1-MODEL for the consumer read (G11, a prior pass).** The bare array
`LookupValueResponse[]` API-MDL-011 returns is accounted for once, in the F2 block that binds it
(`F2 · SCR-MDL-002` below, per ADR-MDL-007): that block already carries its own caller, its own
error answers and `Cache key : n/a`. Modelling it a second time here, in a screen this frontend
renders, instructed an implementer to write a client type nothing in the delivered frontend
consumes; removed rather than kept as documentation, since the F2 block is the complete and
correct place for a foreign contract this plan binds but never emits.

#### F1-SCREEN — SCR-MDL-002
Search model : ownerModuleCode : string · EXACT · key : string · LIKE. **No page, no size, no
               sort** — the request object of API-MDL-010 carries `filters` alone, so none of the
               three is modelled and none belongs in this screen's cache key
Form model   : none — a read-only browse (SRS §B3); no property of the response is writable
Container    : FULL_PAGE, no entry sub-view (ADR-MDL-003) — the owner → types hierarchy is the
               grouped list the endpoint returns, not a second pane with a form in it
The response is a bare array of groups and is modelled as one: reading it through a pagination
envelope would invent fields the endpoint does not send.
