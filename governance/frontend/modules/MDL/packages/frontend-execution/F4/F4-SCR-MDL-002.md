### F4 · SCR-MDL-002 — سجل أنواع اللوكب حسب المالك / Lookup-type registry by owner

#### F4-SCREEN — SCR-MDL-002
Routes       : base slug `type-registry`, under `/reference-data` —
               `/reference-data/type-registry` — the only route. No `new`, no `:id`, no
               `:id/edit`: this screen addresses no record it could edit. The owner module and
               the key filter live in the route's search params, so the browse IS its address
Chunk        : one lazy chunk for this screen
Guard        : the route element guarded by `PERM_MDL_TYPE_REGISTRY_VIEW`, evaluated as
               "`MDL_TYPE_REGISTRY` is in the caller's effective menu"
Facade       : the SCR-MDL-002 facade of F2
Components   : `TypeRegistryPage` (route-level, FULL_PAGE) · `RegistryFilters`,
               `OwnerGroupSection`, `RegistryTypeTable` (presentational)
Mode         : not applicable — no CREATE, EDIT or VIEW mode to resolve; this screen writes
               nothing
Composition  : `none`, resolved: no picker, no child-row editor, no second level and no component
               opened over this page. `OwnerGroupSection` renders the groups the endpoint
               returns, in the endpoint's own grouping
Saves        : none — the screen submits nothing at all. Its one affordance is a link into
               SCR-MDL-001, which is a navigation, not a save
Cross-module : UXD-MDL-001 — here it is the grouping itself and the label on each group heading,
               not a field of a form; its degraded-source fallback is ADR-MDL-015 (G6)
Each type row links to `/reference-data/lookups/:typeId`, which is SCR-MDL-001's own route and
carries its own guard: reviewing and managing are two steps of one task, and this screen does
neither half of the second. API-MDL-011 has no component and no route here (ADR-MDL-007).
