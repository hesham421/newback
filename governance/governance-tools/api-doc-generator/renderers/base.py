Renderer interface. A renderer's only job is turning an already-fully-built
ApiDocument into output files — it must not extract or infer anything itself.
Extraction and rendering are deliberately separate so new output formats
(OpenAPI YAML, Postman/Insomnia collections, frontend model stubs, ...) can
be added later as new Renderer subclasses without touching any extractor.
